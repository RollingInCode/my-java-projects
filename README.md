# my-java-projects

This is a small folder of projects that I've collected throughout my time in school and resources that I've read up on. I plan to create a game, using the Design Patterns that I've learned from the book "Head First: Design Patterns in Java". A pizza game is what I'm looking forward to creating. Especially as a New Yorker, I love my Pizza, and this is the first time I have the chance to create my little pizza demonstration with my artistic skills (with some code as well) haha.

Eventually, I will work on other projects as well, to demonstrate my knowledge in sorting algorithms and such. At this time, I'm still learning about these topics on my own time and intend to grasp the idea of algorithms by the end of this year! A sweet goal for me, as well as a push in my programming career. Wish me luck!
